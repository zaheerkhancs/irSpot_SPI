# iRSpot-SPI(Sequence Physio-chemical Integrator)
## iRSpot-SPI : Meotic Recombination (hotspots/coldspots) prediction model

A classification predictive model for descrimination of meotic recombination hotspot and coldspots.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
#####  Following are the lib need to be installed....
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- python3.6  [follow](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/)
- keras 2.2.4 [follow](https://keras.io/)
- Flask 1.0.2 [follow](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/)
- scikit-learn 0.19.1 [follow](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
- scipy 1.1.0 [follow](https://scipy.org/install.html)
- numpy1.15.4 [follow](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
- matplotlib3.0.2 [follow](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html#building-on-windows/)
- tensorflow 1.12.0 [follow](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/installation)

```
$pip install <lib_name>
```

### Make sure all dependencies are up and running, the propose model was developed using pycharm IDE.

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Example...
```

```
Training.py
```
training.py is used for training the model, and saving the model and model weights for future pretrained model prediction via model.py

```



```
And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
